        <div class="divider paragraph_divider"></div>
        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic"><br>Hong Museum will officially launch the "Situated Resonance" Wenzhou Research Sponsorship Program in 2025, establishing it as the museum's annual flagship initiative from this year onward. This program aims to sustain a focus on the exploration and production of situated knowledge, building an open dialogue platform that interconnects art, social sciences, and the public.<br><br></span></p>
        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic">We believe knowledge is not abstract truth detached from reality, but voices carrying the warmth of the land and the body. This sponsorship program invites "situated" researchers to step into the everyday life and history of Wenzhou, to listen and think from the textures of lived experience, transforming local experiences into new languages and imaginations, thereby evoking responses and resonances that cross geographical boundaries.<br><br></span></p>
        <div class="middle_aligned-wrapper"><img src="images/situated-resonance/图片1.png" loading="lazy" width="500" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 500px" alt="Wenzhou old city" class="image-4"></div>
        <p class="info-basic" style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;">A distant view of Wenzhou's old city; the main street pictured is Jiefang Street.</p>
        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic"><br>In the two years since its opening, Hong Museum has presented a series of exhibitions including "The Forebears are Born"—a subtly provocative examination of Wenzhou's traditional social structures; "Eleven Kinds of Beds"—exploring the relationship between body and space; "The Currents We Carry"—drawing inspiration from local shoe factory culture; and "MAMA"—scrutinizing global colonial issues. Building on this foundation, Hong Museum launches the 2025 "Situated Resonance" Wenzhou Research Sponsorship Program to further expand the social functions of regional art institutions, breaking down the boundaries between art, social sciences, and public engagement, to construct a more experimental and open site for knowledge production and exchange.<br><br></span></p>
        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic">Initiated by Hong Museum, which also established a committee to build an ever-evolving collaborative network. The 2025 "Situated Resonance" Wenzhou Research Sponsorship Program Committee is jointly formed by anthropologist <strong>Xiang Biao</strong>, University of Edinburgh Anthropology Lecturer <strong>Feng Jiang Jiazhi</strong>, artist <strong>Sun Yitian</strong>, art publishing collective <strong>te editions</strong>, founder of Related Department <strong>Meng Xin</strong>, and Director of Hong Museum <strong>Pan Hongzheng</strong>. We now openly invite researchers with genuine interest and independent thinking on this subject.<br><br></span></p>
        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic">Whether you are a <strong>scholar, writer, designer, filmmaker, curator, artist, or any other type of cultural practitioner</strong>, if you hold a sustained curiosity about Wenzhou, we sincerely welcome you. We will provide researchers with funding support, space, research assistance, local network coordination, and discussion/assistance in creative and curatorial development.<br><br></span></p>

        <p class="info-basic" style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;">Wenzhou's old city area primarily consists of 'cheng' (walled areas), 'fang' (blocks), and 'xiang' (lanes).<br>Photo taken in Jiahui Lane; Republican-era residences often feature Baroque-style gate towers.<br>In the Wenzhou dialect, "Jiahui" sounds similar to "Jiaohui" (church), and many church activities were held here in the past.</p>

        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic"><br>Wenzhou, renowned both within China and globally for its unique "fluidity," serves as the focal site for this research program. How does a group famed for its "mobility" continuously practice "topophilia" and creatively reconstruct their sense of belonging? How does global spatial expansion, in turn, reshape local landscapes and emotional structures?<br><br></span></p>
        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic">The Jin Dynasty geomancy master Guo Pu designed the city based on Feng Shui principles, referencing the Big Dipper, the Twenty-Eight Mansions, Yin-Yang, and the Five Elements to arrange the city's plan and functional layout, creating the unique pattern of a "Mountain-Water Dipper City."<br><br></span></p>
        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic">The surrounding mountains endowed this place with deep-rooted stability for clans, beliefs, and customs; while the river networks connecting to the sea constantly catalyzed fluidity characterized by pioneering, diaspora, and cross-cultural integration. Throughout the long flow of history, the city's fate and its spatial form have always mirrored each other, echoing Guo Pu's prophecy: "Walls winding around mountains, ensuring lasting peace and stability" and "Wenzhou's vitality will flourish a millennium from now."<br><br></span></p>

        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic"><br>Looking from the depth of historical sociology, this is the birthplace of the Southern Song "Yongjia School." The philosophical sediments of "combining righteousness and benefit" (emphasizing the balanced unity of moral principles and practical utility) and "applying knowledge for social utility" (focusing on social realities, advocating practical solutions to social problems) cultivated a cultural gene of mercantile ethics and practical wisdom, becoming a theory of "spatial practice" for effective action in the broader world, forming a unique social foundation of grassroots self-organization and market networks.<br><br></span></p>
        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic">In the 1980s, as one of China's first coastal open cities, Wenzhou started from "front store, back factory" family workshops, gradually developing into the "Wenzhou Model" summarized by sociologist Fei Xiaotong—an endogenous development path centered on private economy, market orientation, and regional production-marketing networks.<br><br></span></p>

        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic"><br>In this process, local production clusters based on kinship, geography, and even faith seamlessly connected with grassroots spatial expansion initiated by the people. Hundreds of thousands of Wenzhou people went global, establishing commercial footholds in Paris, Prato, Milan, New York, and elsewhere, forming a unique "Wenzhouese Economic Circle." The traditional social structure of clans did not fade away with global population migration and modernization but transformed into trust capital and credit systems supporting global business networks.<br><br></span></p>
        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic">Simultaneously, the wealth and vitality created by the highly export-oriented private economy continuously fed back into the local urbanization process: a landmark case is the 1987 Wenzhou Yongqiang Airport—China's first civilian airport funded by private capital, where Wenzhou chambers of commerce proactively raised funds and coordinated, contributing over 60 million CNY in social capital out of the total 132 million CNY construction cost. The participation of private capital in shaping transportation hubs, urban renewal, and public landscapes propelled Wenzhou's evolution from a local city to a modern metropolis with global connectivity in a self-reinforcing manner.<br><br></span></p>

        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic"><br>Furthermore, dense religious architecture and a pluralistic landscape of beliefs constitute a social capital reserve and spiritual support system matching the "private economy and global flow," providing an informal institutional foundation for the efficient global resource allocation and reduced transaction costs of the "Wenzhouese Economic Circle."<br><br></span></p>
        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic">Buddhism and Taoism together form Wenzhou's traditional belief systems. Since the introduction of Christianity in the 19th century, it has rapidly developed, giving rise to the region being called "the Jerusalem of China." Ancestral halls, Buddhist temples, Taoist temples, Christian churches, and folk belief shrines often stand side by side, collectively shaping a longstanding, diverse, and co-existing local religious landscape.<br><br></span></p>

        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic"><br>Since the Reform and Opening-up, Wenzhou, drawing on its profound historical sociality, has actively and often informally participated in shaping its developmental path, demonstrating a kind of grassroots, continuous creative tension. Wenzhou is far more than an economic symbol famous for its global trade networks; it is also a social arena of clashing ideas and a "Southeastern Slice" for understanding modern China.<br><br></span></p>

        <p class="content"><span class="info-basic">Wenzhou is a living specimen constantly writing itself anew through the dialectic of the "local" and the "global," a cultural field full of research potential. We seek to deeply understand the historical and social context of Wenzhou, using unique individual perspectives to uncover global narratives hidden within subtle daily routines. We hope to reinterpret the unique texture and spirit of this city from concrete local experiences, embarking on explorations that are both grounded and intellectually inspiring.<br><br></span></p>
