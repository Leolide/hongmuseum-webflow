          <div class="quote-block">
            <p class="content"><span class="info-basic">"...The problem with all this is that your real is not my real.
                We don't all perceive reality the same way... These differences in how we define reality are probably
                why we have fiction."<sup>1</sup></span></p>
          </div>

          <p class="content"><span class="info-basic">This is not exactly a preface, much less a formal "curatorial
              statement"—consider it a bit of background, and a few supplementary thoughts. In March, under the pretext
              of preparing for the exhibition, I followed Li Nu to Wenzhou for the first time. It was also my first time
              stepping into a shoe factory workshop. It was a weekend, yet the workers, the factory owner, the pattern
              makers, and technicians were all absorbed in their respective tasks. "People in Wenzhou get only one day
              off a month—it's been like this for over thirty years," they told me. The workshop roared with machinery,
              flickers of fire, gusts of heat, and the acrid smell of burning. Bodies in labor were immersed in this
              atmosphere. Flowing forward with the relentless rhythm of the moment were the newly made shoes on the
              workstations—each pair soon to set off on its respective path with new owners. Wenzhou-made shoes not only
              supply the domestic market but are exported across the globe. That means what moves along the production
              line in this very moment is, in a way, countless unseen distances—countless people of different skin
              colors, languages, histories, and destinies—and the footprints they will leave on the earth. What a
              meticulous yet vast image! If the history and horizon, here and elsewhere, could be overlaid and revealed
              on the same plane—like a Mercator projection; if every footprint left on the planet, past or future, could
              remain visible; if each individual's path in life could be recorded, recognized, and drawn out; if both
              trickles and torrents could be seen at once…This ordinary weekend afternoon in a small workshop, among
              these seemingly unremarkable assembly lines, marked the moment my imagination was overwhelmed.</span></p>

          <p class="content"><span class="info-basic">Yet perhaps it was precisely in that factory workshop on that
              afternoon that Li Nu's imagination—and his characteristic persistence—was ignited by the unrelenting
              rhythm. It began to stir, to take flight, and ultimately to pierce through time and space, shooting out
              from the small patch beneath his feet to the far end of the globe, to South America; diving headfirst from
              Wenzhou in 2025 back to the eastern shores of the Mediterranean in the 15th century. That was the dawning
              of the global age, later praised as the "Age of Discovery" or the "Great Voyages"—a time when continents
              would gradually come to be seen as mere islands in the ocean, and the sea as yet another road connecting
              them. Human footprints, along with ships, cargo, wealth, blades, shackles, and disease, would soon begin
              to move across the planet at an accelerating, irreversible, and deeply asymmetrical pace. History would
              start to close off countless unrealized divergences, herding them toward a path now claimed to be
              singular and inevitable. But on Li Nu's map, all main roads are side paths; all side paths fork; and all
              forks have never ceased to grow, to mutate, to turn. What drives them is not some unseen giant hand, but
              rather the countless anonymous, blind, humble, chaotic, even staggering footsteps of people. The great
              current formed by these footsteps goes by many names: civilization, trade, enlightenment, revolution,
              conquest, colonization, globalization, capitalism… Together, they herald the world we now inhabit—wrapped
              in the relentless thrum of assembly lines, the bustle of ports and airports, and the mythologies of order,
              efficiency, and progress, which veil the murk from which they emerged. That murk is lit by flickers like
              fireflies in Li Nu's map, where each nameless footprint glows faintly with phosphorescence, like
              wounds scattered across the earth, on the eve of globalization.</span></p>
            <br><br>
          </p>

          <p class="content"><span class="info-basic">The vanishing footsteps never leave behind their own stories—like
              droplets disappearing into a surging current. For the most silent among the silenced, one might ask: "Is
              it possible to construct a story from 'the locus of impossible speech' or resurrect lives from the
              ruins?"<sup>2</sup> Even the most powerful historical lens cannot restore the faces of these nameless
              individuals, nor retrieve their inaudible silences, their irretrievable pasts, their fates marked by
              dispossession, betrayal, and erasure. And yet, through a cartography shaped by imagination, fiction, and
              responsibility, we might begin to look afar, trace, imprint, and reinscribe the paths once taken by these
              forgotten lives—following their footsteps to revisit all the possible and impossible entanglements,
              dispersals, layers, and convergences they have passed through... to see how the past is woven into the
              future, how the distant is stitched into the here and now, how "they" are seamed into "us," and how "we,"
              in turn, are sewn into one another's destinies. This is a journey of imagination and symbols, but also a
              tangible journey defined by crossings and encounters. It is a response to the debts of history, and an
              inquiry into the hopes of today.</span>
            <br><br>
          </p>

          <p class="content"><span class="info-basic">Guided by the faint sparks on the map, Li Nu hands over a boat
              ticket: no destination marked, more of an invitation without promise. Along the way, one might encounter
              towering waves or a sea of tranquil skies. Those who know him understand this duality in his art: the
              distant and the immediate, the monumental and the minute, the symbolic and the concrete, the conflict and
              the reconciliation...He often says he hopes his work speaks to the times—not to small events, but to the
              greater tides of history. And yet, within the densely compressed images, the monumental-scale landscapes,
              and the theatrical narratives that have become his signature, there always lingers a diffuse consciousness
              of resistance, a latent romanticism. These can only emerge from lived experience—from a kind of existence
              that is transparent, anonymous, and fleeting like a droplet in a rushing current; from the instinctive,
              embattled resistance of the individual caught beneath the overwhelming weight of reality, struggling on
              even as resources run thin; from an experience of self-reflection and release of warmth—brief and fragile
              like a firefly in the eternal night of history. Returning to that afternoon in the factory, I still recall
              the roar of machines, the flashes of fire, covering yet accentuating the silence of living labor. As we
              looked at the workers who bent over the assembly line, Li Nu said: We are the same. I don't know if it was
              a sigh, or a self-encouragement, or both. I only know that his insistence on staging this drama across
              time and space is not just for himself, his peers, or his viewers. Perhaps he is thinking of all those
              known and yet unmet travelers, those whose names disappeared into the ocean currents and the folds of
              time—and of those still among us, laboring ceaselessly in this very moment, those women who seem, too
              often, to have no names at all.</span>

          documentary and fiction, representation and abstraction to explore and achieve a poetic language in art.
          Through capturing the details of everyday life, he aims to reflect the individual's mood swings and the
          general state of population in the evolution of macro-society. The apparently unpromising materials of
          everyday life are transformed into something metaphorical, poignant, humorous, poetic and dramatic,
          challenging us to question our received experiences about life and see the world afresh.<br><br>He overturns
          the perceptual boundaries between documentary and fiction, representation and abstraction to explore and
          practice the language of contemporary art. He regards all things as beings with life perception, and in the
          seemingly casual use of materials and unscrupulous artistic expression, there is his keen and rich artistic
          language. His works have strong expansiveness and penetration, both conceptual and sensual, both
          straightforward and implicit, both poetic and realistic, with certain metaphorical, sharp, humorous, poetic
          and dramatic qualities.<br>‍<br>

        <p class="info-basic"><strong>‍</strong>Wenzhou is a city renowned for its high fluidity of population. Located
          in the heart of Wenzhou city, the Hong Museum stands as a beacon of artistic and social exploration. Its
          overarching goal is to rejuvenate and reinstate the interplay among art, social science, and the public by
          presenting and studying contemporary culture and art. We firmly believe that an art museum wields an essential
          influence in shaping society. As the embodiment of this vision, the museum serves as an entity, unifying the
          diverse facets of globalization and constructing a cultural institution that looks optimistically towards the
          future.<br>‍<br>‍<br>‍</p>
